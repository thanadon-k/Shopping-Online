# Shopping Online
### by Thanadon Khonthiang 
#### I am developing a web application using React.js, which will be an online shopping platform. Users will be able to:
1. Add products and quantities to the cart.
1. Apply discounts in the following order: Coupon > On Top > Seasonal.
1. Calculate the total amount the user needs to pay after applying the discounts.
